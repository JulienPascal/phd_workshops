# 2017 PhD Workshops on Computational Methods

In August-September 2017, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) will run a
series of workshops for students entering US PhD programs in economics.

### Outline

The workshops will provide an overview of modern, cutting-edge, open source tools and techniques for
computational modeling, loosely based on the [Quantitative
Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/) lectures by Tom Sargent and John
Stachurski.  

Workshops will be organized and run by John Stachurski and a team of PhD
and postdoctoral students with expertise in computational methods for economic modeling (details to be posted).

The workshop series is supported by the [Alfred P.  Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).

### Topics:

We will cover all or some subset of the following:

* Introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for scientific computing
* Comparisons with [other scientific computing environments](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* Common algorithms for economic modeling (dynamic programming, solving linear and nonlinear equations, etc.)
* [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and workflows
* Statistics, econometrics, [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [visualization](https://matplotlib.org/) and [data management](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Version control](https://github.com/) and software engineering
* [Just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)
* Parallel computing and other aspects of [high performance computing](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/)
* [Cloud computing](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions) and remote infrastructure

### Structure:

Each workshop will

* Last for between half a day and one day, depending on demand and circumstances
* Be free to attend
* Be hands on (bring your laptop!)
* Be open to other PhD students and all faculty at the institutions we visit

Locations and schedule will be announced when available.

### Outcomes:

Participants will

* Receive help setting up all related software on their laptops
* Learn the basics of Python and Julia via lectures and exercises
* Gain an overview of modern scientific computing
* Learn how scientific computing is used in economics
* Be provided with resources for further study

All persistent lecture material will be made freely available through this
site.  All languages and computing platforms we use are free and open source.
