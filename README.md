# 2017 PhD Workshops on Computational Methods

In August-September 2017, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) will run a
series of workshops for students entering US PhD programs in economics.

### Outline

The workshops will provide an overview of modern, cutting-edge, open source tools and techniques for
computational modeling, loosely based on the [Quantitative
Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/) lectures by Tom Sargent and John
Stachurski.  

Workshops will be organized and run by John Stachurski and a team of PhD
students and postdoctoral students with expertise in
computational methods for economic modeling (details to be posted).

The workshop series is supported by the [Alfred P.  Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).

### Topics:

We will cover all or some subset of the following:

* Introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for scientific computing
* Comparisons with [other scientific computing environments](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* Common algorithms (optimization, dynamic programming, etc.)
* [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and workflows
* Statistics, [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [visualization](https://matplotlib.org/) and [data management](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Version control](https://github.com/) and software engineering
* [Just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)
* Parallel computing and other aspects of [high performance computing](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/)
* [Cloud computing](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions) and remote infrastructure

### Workshops

Each workshop will

* Last for between half a day and one day, depending demand and on circumstances
* Be free to attend
* Be hands on (bring your laptop!)
* Be open to other PhD students and all faculty at the institutions we visit

All persistent lecture material will be made freely available through this
site.  All languages and computing platforms we use are free and open source.

Locations and schedule will be announced when available.
