# 2017 QuantEcon PhD Workshops on Computational Economics

In August--September 2017, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) will
run a series of workshops for students entering US PhD programs in economics.
The workshops will provide an overview of modern tools and techniques for
computational economics, loosely based on the [Quantitative
Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/) lectures by Tom Sargent and John
Stachurski.  The workshop series is supported by the [Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).

Workshops will be organized and led by John Stachurski, along with a small
group of PhD students and postdoctoral students with expertise in 
Python, Julia and computational methods for economics 

Topics:

* Introduction to Python and Julia for scientific computing
* Comparisons with other scientific computing environments
* Common algorithms for economic modeling
* Estimation, statistics, visualization and data management
* Version control and software engineering
* Just-in-time compilation 
* Parallel computing and other aspects of high performance computing
* Cloud computing and remote infrastructure

Each workshop will 

* last for between half a day and one day, depending on circumstances
* be free to attend
* be hands on (bring your laptop!)
* be open to other PhD students and all faculty at the institutions we visit

All persistent lecture material will be made freely available through this
site.  Locations and schedule will be announced when available.
